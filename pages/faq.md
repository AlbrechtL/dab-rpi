## What do the three small rectangles in the right above corner mean?
You can only hear a sound if all three rectangles are green. These three rectangles are an indicator for the signal quality and decoding status.

## What are the minimum hardware requirements?
The main hardware requirement is the CPU because the decoding needs a lot of CPU power.

**Recommened**
* CPU: 4 cores x86 CPU with 2 GHz (Intel i-series)
* Display: High resolution with touchscreen
* Graphic card with OpenGL 2.0 support

**Minimum**
* CPU
 * 4 core x86 CPU with 1.3 GHz (Intel Atom Z8300 or Intel Atom Z3736F)
 * 4 core ARM Cortex-A7 CPU with 900 MHz (Raspberry Pi 2)
* Display: 800 x 480 pixels
* Graphic card with OpenGL 2.0 support

Please report if you are able to run welle.io on other hardware platforms.

## Why is my RTL-SDR showed as RTL2838 in welle.io?
Some USB dongles with the product ID (PID) 0x2838 showes RTL2838 as chip but Realtek never had a chip with this name. All these devices have also the Realtek RTL2832U inside.
