Removal of QT from the backend
------------------------------

Goal: Remove QT from the backend, write a QT-less frontend so that we can run
memory testers for the backend. At the same time, modernise the backend.

Regressions to be fixed later:

* We have lost the RTL_TCP input, because there is no cross-platform
  replacement for the QT sockets. Boost::ASIO would be, but we don't want to
  add the dependency for boost.

* qDebug() got replaced by std::clog. Problem? We could probably redirect the stream.

* i18n translation is moved out of the backend. Problem?
