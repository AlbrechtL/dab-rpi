Removal of QT from the backend
------------------------------

Goal: Remove QT from the backend, write a QT-less frontend so that we can run
memory testers for the backend. At the same time, modernise the backend.

Regressions to be fixed later:

* We have lost the RTL_TCP input, because there is no cross-platform
  replacement for the QT sockets. Boost::ASIO would be, but we don't want to
  add the dependency for boost.

* qDebug() got replaced by std::clog. Problem? We could probably redirect the stream.

* i18n translation is moved out of the backend. Problem? The ts files refer to them!

* Test label and DLS parsing with all Charsets! EBU seems to work

* Building with QMake is untested. Same for the Android build.

* Review display of coarse and fine freq corrections. The units were awkward...


Improvements:

* Avoid the copy in void mp4Processor::handle_aacFrame.

* Move onStereo into onNewAudio, avoid having to upmix mono to stereo.

* Improve error handling. Many places could return exceptions

* Improve onFICDecodeSuccess (i.e. announce a count instead of calling the function for every FIB)

* Clarify if Locker is needed in void DabAudio::run()

* Write a ringbuffer replacement that can take advantage of move semantics

* Avoid copies in RTLSDR uint8 to float normalisation
